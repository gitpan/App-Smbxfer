Smbxfer version 0.01

Smbxfer is a module/script hybrid in the spirit of Brian D Foy's "modulino"
concept.  Smbxfer is a command-line tool to transfer data between the local
filesystem and a Samba share.  It supports basic file copying, recursive
directory copying, and simple path mirroring in a manner similar to rsync.

Though the 'smbclient' tool can do most of these things, it appears to be
bound by a timeout limit that, in practice, seemed to limit my transfers to a
bit over a gigabyte.  Smbxfer has no such limitation.  This was the main
motivation behind its development.

As a module, it provides a few useful functions for file transfers to/from
SMB servers.
